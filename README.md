I viewed many Miitomo answers early in the day at like 2am. As a result, my
Miitomo interactions for today appear to not earn me coins. I'm not sure what's
up with that, but I suspect I should be discouraged from late night Miitomo
consumption in the future.

Met with Doug for the first time today. Would recommend.

I sincerely hope that yall are still working on other projects in the meantime. Like this is a nice placeholder for days when you're too busy to even do a codeforces problem (or any coding for that matter), but I really really hope this isn't the only thing you're doing. Also, please keep in mind that other people on the organizing team already know about this. Just as a head's up.

After much effort and many used game tickets, I was finally able to get the
main parts of the ninja costume set. Unfortunately, the katana on the back was
too hard to get, and I have used up all of my game tickets so any further plays
of Miitomo Drop will require coins, which idk if I want to spend. Since missing
an item in Miitomo Drop means you instead win candy, I now have a bunch of
virtual candy I'm not sure what to do with. I know it can be spent on seeing
other people's answers to specific questions if I care enough, but I don't know
if I would care enough about particular answers that I would be able to use all
my candies up on that. Surely there must be other uses for Miitomo candies. I
will look into this issue later.

Zootopia was a phenomenal movie. This is a phenomenal idea. There are bad
things happening in this world, but there are also good things happening. It's
important to recognize all of them.

Raymond

I'm really into this new app Nintendo made called Miitomo. I've got a bunch of  
high school friends on there and it's great to kinda catch up with them by  
seeing their answers to a bunch of pre-generated questions. One thing that  
kinda annoys me about it is that once you add a Miitomo friend through  
Facebook, they don't tell you their Facebook profile anymore, so I can't  
remember who "Zephyr", one of my Miitomo friends is. He's got hair that spikes  
to the side. I suspect he's one of my high school friends, but I have zero  
recollection of adding him, probably because I did it when I was supposed to be 
paying attention in class. I hope I can get closure on this important issue
soon.
