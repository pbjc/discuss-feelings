Zootopia was a phenomenal movie. This is a phenomenal idea. There are bad things happening in this world, but there are also good things happening. It's important to recognize all of them.

I'm really into this new app Nintendo made called Miitomo. I've got a bunch of
high school friends on there and it's great to kinda catch up with them by
seeing their answers to a bunch of pre-generated questions. One thing that
kinda annoys me about it is that once you add a Miitomo friend through
Facebook, they don't tell you their Facebook profile anymore, so I can't
remember who "Zephyr", one of my Miitomo friends is. He's got hair that spikes
to the side. I suspect he's one of my high school friends, but I have zero
recollection of adding him, probably because I did it when I was supposed to be
paying attention in class. I hope I can get closure on this important issue
soon.

I finsished reading a new book called "Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits" and it was AWESOME.
I haven't read a new book in so long; basically been reading the same 20 books for the last 3 years. 
Book was hilarious. I laughed out loud several times and I never do that when I read a book. Ever. 
Also there were very good themes, which I now have to analyze. 
I impulse checked it out at the library and it was the best decisions ever (and maybe the worst 
because I definitely ignored a bunch of hw to finish reading it.) 
I don't know how to write a synopsis without spoilers, so just trust me and everyone read it.
And then come discuss it with me and lets be book-nerds together.
And then I can realize my dreams of starting a book club. <3 <3 <3 <3 
Genres include: sci-fi, actions, adventure, snarky-humor (?) 
Also the author uses a pen name, but everyone knows his real name, so what is the point of his pen name?
