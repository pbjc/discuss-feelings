Zootopia was a phenomenal movie. This is a phenomenal idea. There are bad things happening in this world, but there are also good things happening. It's important to recognize all of them.

I'm really into this new app Nintendo made called Miitomo. I've got a bunch of
high school friends on there and it's great to kinda catch up with them by
seeing their answers to a bunch of pre-generated questions. One thing that
kinda annoys me about it is that once you add a Miitomo friend through
Facebook, they don't tell you their Facebook profile anymore, so I can't
remember who "Zephyr", one of my Miitomo friends is. He's got hair that spikes
to the side. I suspect he's one of my high school friends, but I have zero
recollection of adding him, probably because I did it when I was supposed to be
paying attention in class. I hope I can get closure on this important issue
soon.

And in the wee hours of the morning, I realized, does leader election really even matter that much? Surely not as much as not going over the 80 character limit per line.
